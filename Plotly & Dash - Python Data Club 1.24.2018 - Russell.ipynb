    "\n",
    "You pass special HTML objects to the Dash app, which renders them as real HTML objects in a webapp. To start, you can use the development server to see these webapps or even run them on servers like I do.\n",

    "An example of a simple Dash app I made: [Mortgage Years App](https://mortgage-years.herokuapp.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "Each HTML object can have an ID and several attributes. Dash provides special HTML objects in the `dash_html_components` module that are a lot like normal HTML objects, and wrappers for React components (HTML objects that you can easily talk to) in the `dash_core_components` module. You can even build them yourself if you'd like!\n",
